DNS::Config V0.65
=================

DNS::Config is a collection of Perl modules which provide an
abstraction of a domain name service configuration as well as
daemon specific adaptors for concrete file representations.

The modules origin is the ZoneMaster project which make heavy
use of the module for comprehensive zone file management. Go to
http://www.zonemaster.org for further information.


Prerequisits
------------

As Perl is available in version 5.8.0 now and because version
5.6.0 is already over two years old, I decided to have the
latter one as the minimum required version. Older versions are
no longer supported.


Installation
------------

You install DNS::Config as you would install any perl module
library, by running these command:

If you have CPAN.pm installed and are connected to the Internet

   perl -MCPAN -e shell
   > install DNS::Config
   
or even

   perl -MCPAN -e 'install DNS::Config'
   
otherwise

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


Documentation
-------------

See lib/DNS/Config.pm for an overview of the library. Documentation is 
included in all modules. These are normally converted to manual 
pages and installed as part of the "make install" process.  You should 
also be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract and read 
documentation from the module files directly.


Support
-------

Feel free to send mail directly to author with your questions, comments,
suggestions, bug reports and complaints.
